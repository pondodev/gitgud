# Git Gud -- A Guide in Git and GitHub

Are you a developer? Are you working with developers? Are the developers you're working with annoyed at you cause you commited
to master for the fifth time this week? What even is a master!? Fear not, for this guide is the one for you! Within this
(currently WIP) guide you will be able to learn cool things such as:

- Tracking your project's progress
- Reverting changes
- Committing to ~master~ feature branches
- What a HEAD is and what is it doing at 0d7505cf096e057495233c9648b0d05b46d737ab

Plus much, much more! Don't worry if this all seems confusing, scary, or all of the above becuase we will aim to make this as
simple and beginner friendly as possible!

This guide is aimed towards people new to git and/or GitHub that wish to learn how to use these tools for their project, either
through the command line tool or with a GUI application such as Sourcetree.

## Contributing

This is a small thing that some people have just put together in their spare time because we all know the frustration that comes
along with someone on your team not understanding git. However, we're people too with lives to live (crazy, I know) and jobs to
work so we can only give so much. Please do feel free to make PRs to this repo where you feel we're missing something or could
improve on things. We're more than happy to get all the help we can on this task to help developers everywhere never have to
deal with another merge conflict from improper committing practices again!
