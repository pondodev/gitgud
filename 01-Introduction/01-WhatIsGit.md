# What is git?

git is a piece of software we call version control. Version control (also known as revision control and source control) allows us to do a lot of really cool and useful things when working on codebases, whether it be a solo project or a team project. The main thing that developers use it for is to keep a running record of changes that have been made to a project. This is useful since you are able to go back to these changes as you wish, sort of like a super undo. Another big advantage is it makes collaborating on code much easier since the version control software you decide to use will (generally) handle merging code for you and provide tools such as branches to manage different features being worked on concurrently.

# Okay, so why learn git?

Truth be told, there are many different kinds of version control software out there that can be insanely useful for you based on your needs. The two most popular ones out there currently are subversion and git, with the latter being what you'll learn from reading through everything here. The reason why I've chosen to explain git is twofold:

- It is by far the most popular version control software currently in use
- It is also the only one I know

If you were expecting a comparison between subversion and git, then I'm afraid you won't find that here since I'm nowhere near an authority on both of them. If this all does sound good to you though, then continue on as we delve deeper into git!
